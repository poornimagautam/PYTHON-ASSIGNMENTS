    "1) varaibles are the names given to the storage unit in python \n",
    "2) Depending on the type of data or info being stored in the variable \n",
    "   we can define data types of that variable.\n",
    "3) Name of the variable can't have spaces and special symbols.\n",
    "4) we can store a string into the variable \n",

    "STRING\n",
    "1) string are the sequence of characters that are enclosed in inverted commas \n",
    "   and are used to store information \n",
    "2) String is a data type\n",
    "3) No such restriction of spaces and special symbols is there in the string.\n",
    "4) String can get stores in a variable and occupy a specific place.\n",

    "1) Numeric :This data type stores numeric value and it can further be divided into :\n",

    "               ii) float: when the value stored is not an integer but floating number i.e value is in decimals\n",
    "               iii)complex : when complex number is being stored in the variable\n",
    "2) Sequence: Sequence data type basically includes :\n",
    "                i) string: it is the sequence of char that is used to store information\n",
    "                ii) list: it is mutable data type that can store any number of values of any data type\n",
    "                iii) tuples: thsi are immutable data type that can store any number of values of any data type\n",
    "3)dictionary: dictionaries are the key value pair data type in which we have keys and we assign certain values to \n",
    "              these keys, the way we have words and meanings in the dictionary\n",
